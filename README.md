# openLIS_MVP

This repository exists to demonstrate a Minimal Simple Model (MSM) 
or Minal Viable Product (MVP) implementation of Learned Index Structures (LIS). 

I will create a new repository (openLIS) that defines an actual Python module with clean
code, rather than continue down the Jupyter notebook path started in this repository.
